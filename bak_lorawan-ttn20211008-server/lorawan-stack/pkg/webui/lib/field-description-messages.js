    'The class C timeout determines how long the network will wait for a response for downlinks that require confirmation (e.g. confirmed downlink messages or MAC commands). During that period no other downlinks will be sent.',
  classCTimeoutLocation:
    'This is dependant on your exact use case. It can help to consider the following implications: timeouts that are too long can be prone to blocking communication when replies are not sent immediately. On the other hand, timeouts that are too short might miss the reply when it arrives later.',
  classCTimeoutAbsence:
    'Leave this field empty to let the network apply a default value that should be applicable for most use cases.',

  gatewayPlacementDescription:
    'Informs whether the gateway antenna is placed inside or outside. This information is used solely for display purposes, e.g. on public gateway maps (if your gateway is set as public) and has no technical or functional effects.',

  setClaimAuthCodeDescription:

    'The class B ping slot uses a fixed frequency and data rate. This value configures the data rate to use in class B ping slots.',

  beaconFrequencyDescription:
    'The class B beacon is sent on a fixed frequency. This value changes the frequency to use in class B beacons.',
