This is the new default.\n  - The `json` format that prints logs as JSON. This is the recommended format for production deployments.\n  - The `old` format (deprecated). This can be used if you need to adapt your log analysis tooling before v3.14.\n- `ttn_lw_gs_ns_uplink_latency_seconds`, `ttn_lw_ns_as_uplink_latency_seconds` and `ttn_lw_gtw_as_uplink_latency_seconds` metrics to track latency of uplink processing.\n- Signing of releases.\n- Hard delete option to delete applications, gateways and organizations in the Console.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Relaxed the cookie policy for cross-origin requests from Strict to Lax.\n- Changed the cookie policy for OAuth state to None.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- The `old` log format is deprecated and will be removed in v3.14.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Permissions issue for reading and writing gateway secrets in the Console.\n- Current and future rights selection for organization collaborators in the Console.\n- Current and future rights selection for user api keys in the Console.\n- Low or no throughput of message handling from Packet Broker when the ingress is high when Packet Broker Agent starts.\n- Unset ADR bit in downlink messages to multicast devices.\n\n\n\n## Docker images\n\n- `docker pull thethingsnetwork/lorawan-stack:3.13`\n- `docker pull thethingsnetwork/lorawan-stack:3.13.2`\n- `docker pull ghcr.io/thethingsnetwork/lorawan-stack:3.13`\n- `docker pull ghcr.io/thethingsnetwork/lorawan-stack:3.13.2`\n"

    "body": "\n### Added\n\n- Searching Packet Broker networks with `--tenant-id-contains` and `--name-contains` flags.\n- Listing all listed Packet Broker networks with `ttn-lw-cli packetbroker networks list`.\n- Include end device version identifiers in upstream messages (see `uplink_message.version_ids.brand_id`, `uplink_message.version_ids.model_id`, `uplink_message.version_ids.firmware_version`, `uplink_message.version_ids.hardware_version` and `uplink_message.version_ids.band_id` fields).\n- Reporting uplink and downlink message delivery state changes to Packet Broker. This will be used for statistical purposes (e.g. which message is processed successfully or why it errored) as well as LoRaWAN roaming (the `XmitDataAns` result code).\n- Setting API key expiry via `--api-key-expiry` flag using RFC3339 format.\n  - This requires a database schema migration (`ttn-lw-stack is-db migrate`) because of the added columns.\n- Events storage in the Redis events backend. This can be enabled with the new `events.redis.store.enable` option. The new options `events.redis.store.ttl`, `events.redis.store.entity-ttl`, `events.redis.store.entity-count` and `events.redis.store.correlation-id-count` can be used to configure retention.\n- RPC to find related events by correlation ID.\n- CLI command `events find-related`.\n- Support for loading Device Repository profiles from different vendors if specified. This allows reusing standard end device profiles from module makers and LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.\n- Filtering out verbose events in the event views in the Console.\n- The `gs.up.forward` event now includes the host an uplink was forwarded to.\n- Previews for `*.update` events in the Console.\n- The Console can now show recent historical events in networks that have events storage enabled.\n- Add a new `mac_settings.desired_max_eirp` field that can be configured to set the desired MaxEIRP value per device.\n- Support loading rate limiting profile configuration from external sources. When set, they will override embedded configuration. See `rate-limiting.config-source`, `rate-limiting.directory`, `rate-limiting.url` and `rate-limiting.blob.*` configuration options.\n- `IssueDevEUI` RPC for requesting a DevEUI from a configured IEEE MAC block for devices per application.\n  - This requires a database schema migration (`ttn-lw-stack is-db migrate`) because of the added `eui_blocks` table and `dev_eui_counter`\n    column in applications table.\n  - This requires a new `dev-eui-block` configuration setting.\n\n### Changed\n\n- User IDs now have a minimum length of 2 instead of 3, so that more users coming from v2 can keep their username.\n- Disabled device uplink simulation and downlink message sending when skipping payload crypto.\n- The UpdateAPIKey RPCs now take a fieldmask.\n- The Gateway Server no longer sends `gs.up.drop` event if the Network Server does not handle an uplink message, or if the uplink does not match the DevAddr prefix of an upstream.\n- Maximum size for user-defined payload formatter scripts.\n  - The default cap is at 4KB, see the new `as.formatters.max-parameter-length` config option.\n  - A maximum cap of 16KB per script is set at the API level.\n  - This only prevents setting large payload formatter scripts for new devices and applications; it does not remove payload formatters from existing applications and devices. Scripts sourced from the Device Repository are not affected. See [issue #4053](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack/issues/4053) for more context on this change.\n- LoRa Basics Station `router_config` message omits hardware specific fields.\n- Showing \"Last seen\" information in end device tables (replacing \"Created\").\n\n### Removed\n\n- The `gs.status.forward` event.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- OAuth token exchange for OAuth clients that use Basic auth.\n- The CLI now properly returns a non-zero exit status code on invalid commands.\n- Gateway connection requests with zero EUI are rejected.\n- End device payload formatter reset to `FORMATTER_NONE` in the Console.\n- Memory issues when importing end devices in the Console.\n\n\n\n## Docker images\n\n- `docker pull thethingsnetwork/lorawan-stack:3.13`\n- `docker pull thethingsnetwork/lorawan-stack:3.13.0`\n- `docker pull ghcr.io/thethingsnetwork/lorawan-stack:3.13`\n- `docker pull ghcr.io/thethingsnetwork/lorawan-stack:3.13.0`\n"

For OTAA all data is wiped and device must rejoin, for ABP session keys, device address and downlink queue are preserved, while MAC state is reset.\r\n- Store and retrieve Gateway Claim Authentication Code from database.\r\n  - This requires a database schema migration (`ttn-lw-stack is-db migrate`) because of the added column.\r\n  - This uses the same encryption key set using the `is.gateways.encryption-key-id` configuration option.\r\n- Improved handling of connection issues in the Console, as well as automatic reconnects.\r\n- Helpful details for synthetic meta events in the data view of the Console.\r\n- Support field mask paths in Storage Integration API requests.\r\n- CUPS redirection.\r\n  - This requires a database schema migration (`ttn-lw-stack is-db migrate`) because of the added columns.\r\n- Configuration option (`is.user-registration.enabled`) to enable or disable user registrations.\r\n- Missing CLI commands for getting single API keys or collaborators for entities.\r\n- New Account App for authentication, authorization and account related functionality.\r\n  - This introduces various UX improvements and new designs around e.g. user login, registration and the \"forgot password\" flow.\r\n- Integrate Device Repository.\r\n- Device Repository component to integrate [Device Repository](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices) with The Things Stack. See the `dr` configuration section.\r\n  - The Device Repository database is bundled automatically into Docker release images.

E.g. if RPC supports paths `A` and `A.B`, sending value with `A.C` non-empty and field mask `A` would result in an error.\r\n- Improved content of emails sent by the Identity Server.\r\n- Stricter validation of the maximum length of string fields, binary fields, lists and maps.\r\n- Frequency plans and webhook templates are now included in Docker images, and used by default, instead of fetching directly from GitHub.\r\n- JavaScript entrypoints changed from `oauth.css` and `oauth.js` to `account.css` and `account.css`. Note: For deployments using custom frontend bundles (e.g. via `--is.oauth.ui.js-file`), the filenames have to be updated accordingly as well.\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n- Application Server linking.
